# This workflow will build and push a new Docker image to the default Artifact Registry in SSB.
#
# Overview:
# 1. Authenticate to Google Cloud
# 2. Authenticate to Artifact Registry
# 3. Build and publish a docker image to Google Artifact Registry
# 
# To configure this workflow:
# 1. Change the values for the IMAGE_NAME, TEAM_NAME and TAG environment variables (below).
# 
# This workflow is tailored for SSBÂ´s setup, however if you wish to use this in a non SSB context ensure/change the following:
# 1. Create GitHub secrets for GAR_PROJECT_NUMBER and GAR_PROJECT_ID (Number and ID for the Artifact Registry project).
# 2. Create and configure Workload Identity Federation for GitHub.
